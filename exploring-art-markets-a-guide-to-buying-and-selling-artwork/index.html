Being aware of these trends can inform your buying or selling strategies.</p><p>9. Insurance and Conservation:</p><p>When owning artwork, it is crucial to protect and preserve its condition. Consider obtaining insurance to safeguard against theft, damage, or loss. Additionally, consult professionals for conservation and restoration services to ensure the longevity and integrity of the artwork.</p><p>10. Enjoy the Journey:</p><p>Exploring the art market should be an enjoyable and enriching experience.
