Property insurance:<br>Property insurance protects real estate agents&rsquo; property, including office contents, computers, furniture, signage, and other valuable assets. It also extends coverage to property in their care, custody, or control, such as keys, documents, or staging items.</p><p>d. Cyber liability insurance:<br>In today&rsquo;s digital age, real estate agents handle sensitive client information and transmit it over the internet. Cyber liability insurance provides coverage for data breaches, cyber-attacks, and identity theft, helping to recover the costs associated with notifying affected individuals, legal defense, and regulatory fines.</p><p>e. Employment practices liability insurance (EPLI):<br>Real estate agents often have employees or work with independent contractors. Employment practices liability insurance provides coverage for claims arising from allegations such as discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, or other employment-related issues.</p><p>3.
